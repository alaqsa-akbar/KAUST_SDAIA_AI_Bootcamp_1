# KAUST Academy and SDAIA AI Bootcamp 1 (Introduction to AI)
This repo contains the files I worked on during the first bootcamp. The bootcamp introduces the learner to AI where they learn about Linear Regression, Logistic Regression and Classification, and Neural Networks along with all their maths and different hyperparameters such as optimizers and acitvation functions.
